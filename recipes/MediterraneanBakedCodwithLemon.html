    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground pink salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) cod filets</li>
        <li>2 lemons, each cut into 8 thin slices</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p1> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p1>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p1>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, 
        and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each 
        other and the butter, cutting and mixing as you go. Add pink salt, 
        black pepper, and paprika, and mix until well blended.</p1>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p1>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, 
        place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; 
        use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. 
        Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices. </p1>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p1>Bake in the preheated oven until
         cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. 
         See note.</p1>
    <br>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p1>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, 
        and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. </p1>
